  1. Our system Is using the MVC design pattern, where the Seat class represents a single seat in the
theater,and the Row class represents a row of seats. The Theater class represents the overall theater
with its rows and seats.These classes hold the state of the system and provide methods to manipulate and
retrieve the data. Therefore, they are the classes that represent the Model layer of the MVC architecture.

  2. The ReservationsService class is the controller as it handles the business logic for reserving seats,
sorting rows, and updating the seating in the theater.

  3. On the other hand, the ReservationSystem class handles the user interface and input/output operations.
Therefore, it could be considered as the View part of the MVC pattern.
