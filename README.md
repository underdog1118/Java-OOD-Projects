### Project_2 - Assign8  :

The problem: Insurance company communication automation

You are a member of an IT team for a nationwide insurance company. Unfortunately, your company recently suffered a devastating data breach. Private and sensitive data of millions of your customers may now be compromised…

The whole company is still grappling with the consequences of the breach, but the clock is already ticking – it is time to inform the customers. The members of the board of the company have decided to send an email informing every customer about the data breach. Then, the company will also send the same information using the regular mail. They are asking you to help them out, and to automate the process that the insurance company will use to communicate with its customers.
